description: >
  Basic Probe Driver (BPD) deployment with self-contained trigger generation.
  
  INTENTIONAL SIGNAL PATH:
  - Slot1 (Oscilloscope) Pattern Generator OutputA → Slot2 (BPD) InputA (trigger_in)
  - This enables closed-loop testing without external DUT hardware
  
  MONITORING:
  - Slot2 (BPD) OutputC (Debug-Bus) → Slot1 (Oscilloscope) InputA
  - BPD-Debug-Bus (14-bit HVS) provides FSM state visibility
  
  Suitable for: Initial bring-up, FSM debugging, probe characterization, self-contained validation.

slots:
  1:
    instrument: Oscilloscope
    # Frontend settings (input channels) - empty dict, no frontend config needed
    # InputA: BPD-Debug-Bus (14-bit HVS encoded voltage)
    # InputB: Probe monitor feedback (optional, from PHY_IN2)
    settings: {}
    waveform_output:
      # Waveform Generator OutputA configuration
      # OutputA → Slot2.InputA (BPD trigger input)
      channel: 1  # Output channel 1 (OutputA)
      enable: true
      waveform_type: "Square"  # Square wave for trigger pulses (must be capitalized: Sine, Square, Triangle, etc.)
      frequency: 1000  # 1 kHz trigger rate (adjustable)
      amplitude: 2.5  # 2.5V amplitude (0-5V range, safe for TTL)
      offset: 1.25  # 1.25V offset (centers 0-2.5V swing around 1.25V)
      # Note: These parameters create a 0-2.5V square wave suitable for BPD trigger input
    description: >
      Monitors BPD-Debug-Bus on InputA and optionally probe current on InputB.
      Waveform Generator OutputA produces synthetic trigger signal routed to Slot2.InputA (BPD trigger input).
      This enables self-contained testing without external DUT hardware.

  notes: >
    Initial deployment configuration for BPD validation.
    Use this setup for:
    - FSM state machine debugging (via BPD-Debug-Bus)
    - Probe characterization without DUT
    - Closed-loop timing validation
    - Safe bring-up before live FI campaigns
