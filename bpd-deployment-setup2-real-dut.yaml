  notes: >
    Production deployment configuration for live FI campaigns.
    Use this setup for:
    - Real hardware target glitching
    - Live FI campaign execution
    - DUT-synchronized probe firing
    - Production-grade fault injection

    Safety notes:
    - Verify DUT trigger voltage <5V before connecting to PHY_IN1
    - Validate probe monitor polarity (DS1120A: negative-going = higher current)
    - Confirm cooldown_interval appropriate for probe thermal limits
    - Monitor BPD-Debug-Bus for unexpected FSM states
